This was our final project for the Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp.

Description:
Mobile web app designed to enhance communication between landlords and tenants through a ticketing system and built-in chat for each ticket.

Features:
Users can add multiple houses and assign tenants (who have already signed up) to each house using an expandable 'Rent a Room' form. 
Once a tenant is assigned to a house by the landlord (the user who added the house to the platform), this unlocks the ability to create tickets and engage in a corresponding chat. 
Only the landlord can change the ticket status, and tickets are filtered for each house and pending status. 
The history of solved tickets is also available.

Hope you enjoy!
